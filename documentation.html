    <p>From Wikipedia, the <em>free</em> encyclopedia</p>

    <p><b>A sundial measure time by the position ofthe sun.</b> The most commonly seen designs, such <br>
        as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of <br>
        the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However, <br>
        sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.
    </p>    

    <p>Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variation can measures standard and daylight saving time, as well.</p>

    <h2><b>History</b></h2>
